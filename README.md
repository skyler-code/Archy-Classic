# ArchyClassic
Archy is an assistant for Archaeologists that want information at their fingertips.

This is an unofficial port of a port of the addon to work with Cataclysm Classic 4.4

Thanks to Torhal for making the addon.

Thanks to RaulPerez1. He made an incomplete port of the addon to BFA, and javier_himura checked his version on some parts of the code he had problems making to work with Shadowlands.

Thanks to javier_himura. He made it insanely easy to port this to Cataclysm Classic
